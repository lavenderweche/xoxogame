# OVERVIEW

This is a game of X and Os or also known as Tic Tac Toe. The simple game has been created for my JavaScript module project submission. 
It consists of two players who have to get 3 X's or O's in a row (including a diagonal row), with X being the first player.

## Target Audience
This is a very simple game to be used to pass time. You could be on a bus, train or in the park looking for something to keep you busy, and this would be the perfect game for that. It takes a very short time to play it but, would definitely keep you busy for a while. 
It can also be used by children to keep them busy and used to develop their brains by trying to make them think logically so as to win the game.

## Project Goals

- This site presents a game of X and O
- I am currently trying to build my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills and the game contained a combination of all.

## Design Choices and Colors 

Since the site only comprises of a small box with user entries requires. The font sizes used are big to allow visually impared users to interact with the site at ease. 
I kept this very simple when it came to the colours because learning from my previous projecty, "less seems to be more in UI".
The color choice of the font is orange, because as I was reserching, the orange color used was one of the color blind friendly choices.

The game does not require much when it comes to the positioning, so I ensured that the entry boxes are in the centre of the page.

# Features
- **The entry box:** the game players can play the game by clicking on the box that they would like to make the entry.
- **First Player:** the first player is the X player, this is because just like the name suggests "X and O", the game has to start with the X player followed by the O player.
- **Validation:** the validation is done to check who has won, by checking the positions/boxes which contain the entry and determine whether there are any entries that have been put in a row. The winner is whoever gets to 3 Xs OR Os in a straight or diagonal row.
- **Results:** when one of the player wins, the results are displayed on the screen.

## Implemented Features

The implemented features are more or less the same as the ones above under the features section. The focus for this game was mostly on the JavaScript logic so most of the UI features from the other HTML and CSS modules were not implemented in this. 


## Future Features

In the future, I would like to implement more features. See below.

- Play online with other players.
- Expand on the user interfacef so that it is more appealing to children too


## Testing

1. Validation of the entries: tested that the winner can actually be determined by the entries that the player inputs.
2. Responsiveness: the game responds to the decreasing of the screen
3. Game results: the game results show up when a user wins.

## Compatibility and Responsive Testing

Minimally you should use dev tools and emulators to try to test you site on various screen sizes and browsers and note it in a table:

I ensured my site was worked well, and looked nice on a variety of devices & browsers as noted in the table below:

| TOOL / Device                 | BROWSER     | OS         | SCREEN WIDTH  |
|-------------------------------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| browser stack: iPhone14 pro  |safari  13    | iOs        | XS 320 x 568  |
| browserstack windows PC       | Chrome 78   | windows 10 | XL 1920 x 946 |
| real computer: mac book pro   | safari 12.1 | Mohave     | XL 1400 x 766 |


## Outstanding Defects
 
- There is no 404 page error
- There are certain areas on the box that the user should click on for the letter to appear.



## Accessibility Testing
I did not get the time to perform any accessibility tests but I will make sure to get this done after the submission is graded to improve the game.

### Accessibility Audits
I did not get the time to perform any accessibility tests but I will make sure to get this done after the submission is graded to improve the game.
