# OVERVIEW

This is a game of X and Os or also known as Tic Tac Toe. The simple game has been created for my JavaScript module project submission. 
It consists of two players who have to get 3 X's or O's in a row (including a diagonal row), with X being the first player.

# UX

## Target Audience
This is a very simple game to be used to pass time. You could be on a bus, train or in the park looking for something to keep you busy, and this would be the perfect game for that. It takes a very short time to play it but, would definitely keep you busy for a while. 
It can also be used by children to keep them busy and used to develop their brains by trying to make them think logically so as to win the game.

## Project Goals

- This site presents a game of X and O
- I am currently trying to build my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills and the game contained a combination of all.

### Site User Stories

## Design Choices and Colors 

Since the site only comprises of a small box with user entries requires. The font sizes used are big to allow visually impared users to interact with the site at ease. 
I kept this very simple when it came to the colours because learning from my previous projecty, "less seems to be more in UI".
The color choice of the font is orange, because as I was reserching, the orange color used was one of the color blind friendly choices.
![alt text](<Color Palette.png>) from the https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/1007680 site.

The game does not require much when it comes to the positioning, so I ensured that the entry boxes are in the centre of the page.

# Features
- **The entry box:** the game players can play the game by clicking on the box that they would like to make the entry.
- **First Player:** the first player is the X player, this is because just like the name suggests "X and O", the game has to start with the X player followed by the O player.
- **Validation:** the validation is done to check who has won, by checking the positions/boxes which contain the entry and determine whether there are any entries that have been put in a row. The winner is whoever gets to 3 Xs OR Os in a straight or diagonal row.
- **Results:** when one of the player wins, the results are displayed on the screen.

## Implemented Features
ðŸš¨**Required** 

The implemented features are more or less the same as the ones above under the features section. The focus for this game was mostly on the JavaScript logic so most of the UI features from the other HTML and CSS modules were not implemented in this. 


## Future Features

In the future, I would like to implement more features. See below.

- Play online with other players.
- Expand on the user interfacef so that it is more appealing to children too


## Testing

1. Validation of the entries: tested that the winner can actually be determined by the entries that the player inputs.
2. Responsiveness: the game responds to the decreasing of the screen
3. Game results: the game results show up when a user wins.


### CSS Validation

## Compatibility and Responsive Testing
ðŸš¨**Required** 

Minimally you should use dev tools and emulators to try to test you site on various screen sizes and browsers and note it in a table:

I ensured my site was worked well, and looked nice on a variety of devices & browsers as noted in the table below:

| TOOL / Device                 | BROWSER     | OS         | SCREEN WIDTH  |
|-------------------------------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| browser stack: iPhone14 pro  |safari  13    | iOs        | XS 320 x 568  |
| browserstack windows PC       | Chrome 78   | windows 10 | XL 1920 x 946 |
| real computer: mac book pro   | safari 12.1 | Mohave     | XL 1400 x 766 |


## Defect Tracking
ðŸš¨**Required** 

Try to create issues in real time as it better reflects the daily life of a developer.

The easiest way to track defects is by using GITHUB's Issues to track these as it's really easy to copy/paste screenshots in and then write up how you closed them. At this stage you don't need a custom template or labels, that comes in P4.

Here's a quick [overview of creating GitHub issues](Defects.md)

You can also just bullet point them here, or create a google spreadsheet and link to that here.


## Outstanding Defects
 
- There is no 404 page error
- There are certain areas on the box that the user should click on for the letter to appear.



## Accessibility Testing
I did not get the time to perform any accessibility tests but I will make sure to get this done after the submission is graded to improve the game.

### Accessibility Audits
I did not get the time to perform any accessibility tests but I will make sure to get this done after the submission is graded to improve the game.

**Contrast Checkers**

### Keyboard Navigation
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

Another way to accessibility test your site is to try to click on the browser URL and see what happens if you use the tab, arrow and enter keys. Does it work well or does the user get stuck? Check this in a couple browsers as the focus & active outlines are typically styled by the browser

The expected results for various keyboard entries and field types can be found [here](https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/#testing)

You can take a video of this testing if you want and convert it to a gif and paste that into your readme. Record something to yourself in a Slack direct message, then download it. Then you can use https://cloudconvert.com/mp4-to-gif to convert the mp4 to a gif and just paste it into the readme via GiHu, and it'll resolve itself.


### Chrome Vox Reader
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

If you are really ambitious, you can use the [VoxReader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screen-reader/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn?hl=en) extension in chrome to see what your site sounds like on a screen reader. It really drives home the need for good aria-labels & semantic HTML.

# Technologies Used
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

This section just summarizers tools and programming languages you used.

## Languages
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

-write bullet points for the languages you used (HTML & CSS)

## Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

List out the tools you used with a link and a short description (this helps others figure out where to get the bonus points & reminds you what you used for your next project
- Balsamiq
- Coolors.co
- fontawesome
- gitpod
- github
- google fonts
- font awesome
- amiresponsive
- table of contents creator
- markdown table generator


# Deployment
ðŸš¨**Required** 

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages).

-Enumerate steps and use screenshots to make the instructions are clear.

You may want to re-watch the [initial deployment in gitpod video](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+LR101+2021_T1/courseware/4a07c57382724cfda5834497317f24d5/9b06129195c64fada6783de9cfe82d60/) when writing up this section.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
ðŸš¨**Required** 

Write out steps you would take and test them to deploy your code to GitHub Pages, include screenshots if you think they would make the process easier.

## Forking The Repository
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

A fork creates a completely independent copy of Git repository. In contrast to a fork, a Git clone creates a linked copy that will continue to synchronize with the target repository, so if you want to ensure other people don't commit to your public repo, you might want to tell them to fork the repository :) 

## Run Locally With GitPod
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

Enumerate and write the steps of how to run a project locally via gitPod. Include Screenshots to maximize the impact of the instructions.

# Credits
ðŸš¨**Required** 

To avoid plagiarism amd copyright infringement, you should mention any other projects, stackoverflow, videos, blogs, etc. that you used to gather imagery or ideas for your code even if you used it as a starting point and modified things. Giving credit to other people's efforts and ideas that saved you time acknowledges the hard work others did.  The accessors expect something here, there is no way you didn't have to get help on making such a nice project.

## Content
ðŸš¨**Required** 

Use bullet points to list out sites you copied text from and cross-reference where those show up on your site. If you truly are an expert in the content you provided, say that due to your exposure/experience of the topic covered, you created the content on your own.

## Media
ðŸš¨**Required** 

Make a list of sites you used images, icons & youtube, & audio files from. If you used several sites try to match up each image to the correct site. This includes attribution for icons if they came from font awesome or other sites, give them credit. If you took the images yourself, give yourself credit.

You should not be using images taken from copyrighted sites, but only royalty free ones. Try typing `!copyright` in slack and see what help it gives you for this topic.

## Acknowledgments
ðŸš€ **merit & beyond**

This is the section where you refer to code examples, mentors, blogs, stack overflow answers and videos that helped you accomplish your end project. Even if it's an idea that you updated you should note the site and why it was important to your completed project.

If you used a CodeInstitute Example project as a starting point. Make note of that here.
